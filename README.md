# Spotify-Hit-Predictor
Spotify hit predictor is built using Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier models. A dataset of songs from 1960 to 2019 including various audio features along with their authors is obtained from Kaggle. A comparison analysis is done for two eras (1960-1989 and 1990-2019) and the songs are predicted as hit or flop using the decision tree and random forest algorithms. Moreover, key audio features which are critical to make a song hit for the audience are identified through variable of importance.
